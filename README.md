# Front End Development - First Project

## First Project of Up School FD Bootcamp

I completed my first task in Up School Front End Development Bootcamp. I prepared a website designed by Mehedii Mohammed, you can find his designs on Dribbble:  https://dribbble.com/mehedii_99. 

I chose one of his designs and tried to make it using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. You can find this design: https://dribbble.com/shots/16929577-Xprako-Organic-Food-Web-Xd-Landing-Page

Thanks to Mehedii Mohammed for sharing his design with me.
